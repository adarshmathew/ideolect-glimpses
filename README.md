[About _Ideolect's of Reddit_](https://adarshmathew.github.io/projects/ideolect/)

tl;dr: Subreddits speak specific languages which belie its values, worldviews, and incentives for interaction. We[^1] try to understand inter- and intra-community conflict (legitimate and otherwise) through this lens, while accounting for the network interactions of users.

This repository contains snippets of code from my work on the project, usually accompanied by a [post on my blog](https://adarshmathew.github.io/posts/) that walks through what I was thinking about when working on this element. They might be disparate, but would give you an idea of how we're approaching the host of sub-questions that come with studying Reddit.
